The Digilent Toolbox allows users to acquire and analyze data in MATLAB from Digilent's Analog Discovery, Analog Discovery 2, Analog Discovery Studio, Analog Discovery Pro ADP3250 and ADP3450, Electronic Explorer, and Discovery Power Supply DPS3340.
Featuring Analog data streaming, Digital I/O control, and configurable Power Supplies, users can easily collect and send data from Digilent Test and Measurement devices, either directly or with the newly added non-blocking functions with no software limitation on the sampling rate.
